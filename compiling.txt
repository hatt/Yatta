Supported Delphi Versions

Compiling yatta should work in delphi 7 and later (2005, 2006, turboexplorer and 2007) 
with all the different patching levels. Delphi 6 may also be possible to
use but it hasn't been tried recently. Earlier versions are guaranteed
to fail due to missing compiler directives.



Dependencies

Graphics32 - http://www.graphics32.org/wiki/

FastMM4 (Optional) - http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastmm
Just remove it from the uses clause if you don't want to use it. It's
mostly useful for debugging.
