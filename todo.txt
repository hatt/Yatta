<mirkosp> have two custom lists
<Myrsloik_> you mean so you can have two seleccted at the same time?
<mirkosp> possibly with a lot of entries already
<mirkosp> keep the tools window at disposal with the custom list tab
<mirkosp> and have one selected
<mirkosp> then
<mirkosp> try to click directly on the other custom list's name while on the main yatta window
<mirkosp> gives me List index out of bounds (10)
<mirkosp> although sometimes it gives another number
<Eilafan> Lord: as far as I can see analog TV in Japan just followed NTSC's usual recommendations in that way
<mirkosp> if I click ok, error keeps popping up
<Daemon404> woah
<Daemon404> woah
<Daemon404> wait
<mirkosp> so I p much have to kill yatta

save decimate/tdecimate decisions and add a config dialog

cutter allows insertion of overlapping ranges?
zoom out in ymc dialogs, general implementation?
