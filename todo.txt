Fix memory leak when closing ymc programmatically
move ymc progress bars to the main window
fix edge case frame trim(0,0) kept when cutting
zoom out in ymc dialogs, general implementation?
cutter allows insertion of overlapping ranges?
desuckify the cutting window

[22:57] <Myrsloik> like adding them to all new projects?
[22:57] <Mentar> there are certain things I need to do all the time
[22:57] <Mentar> and adding Reblend as Custom list and importing the default presets are among the most annoying
[23:00] <Myrsloik> this requires the invention of a badly crafted system using weird delimiters and a hereto unknown file format...
[23:01] <Mentar> how about the ability to define a "default yap"
[23:01] <Mentar> and when ymc creates a new project, the settings from this default yap are loaded
[23:01] <Mentar> would that be possible?
[23:02] <Myrsloik> yes, I guess so
[23:02] <Myrsloik> what settings should it be possible to copy? custom lists? sections? presets?
[23:03] <Mentar> custom lists, presets, cropping/resizing defaults

[21:34] <Mentar> could you do this:
[21:34] <Mentar> When you change a match this way, could you shift the section boundary accordingly?
[21:34] <Mentar> as in, if you change a match to next frame, could you push the section boundary one to the next too?
[21:35] <Mentar> no wait it's the other way around
[21:35] <Mentar> if you change it to next frame, it needs to be moved -1
[21:36] <Mentar> or is my brain rotten
[21:36] <Mentar> wait
[21:36] <Mentar> I've drunken too much
[21:36] <Mentar> once I'm sober again, I'll write it down properly ^_^;
[21:37] <Mentar> currently, one effect is that if you use it, you sometimes have one frame "overlap", which makes the section boundary seem off by 1 frame

[01:06] <ViruX> since the topic was YATTA questions, i have two questions as well: what does the "Extend Distance to 5" hotkey do?
Is there any hotkey to switch active custom list(like there is for current preset used on the section)?

save "error log" to project and load on open

[00:21] <Mentar> did you already fix that the "select smalles vmetric at scenechanges" function has an uninitialized default?

[21:57] <Mentar> the YMC requests:
[21:57] <Mentar> please add an option which:
[21:58] <Mentar> 1) creates a copy of the .avs you use for analyzing - for a "cut quick-and-dirty raw with telecide and decimate"
[21:58] <Mentar> so that for a TLraw I don't need to wait for YMC to finish
[21:58] <Mentar> see what I mean?
[21:58] <Myrsloik> ok
[21:58] <Myrsloik> should be doable I guess
[21:59] <Mentar> 2) creates an audio.avs which takes the audio.aac file, extracts the displacement, and does a "Save Audio AVS"
[21:59] <Mentar> the dgindex output is normed, it should be easy to scan
[22:00] <Myrsloik> like with the audio file writer plugin or something?
[22:00] <Mentar> would that be okay? It would really help alot
[22:00] <Myrsloik> I guess
[22:00] <Myrsloik> so
[22:00] <Mentar> you know what "Save Audio AVS" does in Yatta - basically, the same thing
[22:00] <Myrsloik> now excuse me for I must work on my heart attack
[22:00] <Mentar> so that the quick-and-dirty TLraw can have audio too

[22:52] <Mentar> 1) in ymc, could we have an option that when YMC starts working off a job with cutter and stuff, we get a copy of an .avs file for a quick workraw (and preferably also audio avs file)?
[22:52] <Mentar> this is the background
[22:53] <Mentar> I'd like to be able to encode a quick crapraw immediately, at the same time I do the ymc metrics collection
[22:53] <Mentar> so that the translator can start work immediately
[22:53] <Mentar> something like this should only be a variation of the .avs you need to create anyway
[22:53] <Mentar> right?
[22:54] <Mentar> so, optimal usage would be a "quickraw" entry like SCXvid and the likes, and it simply barfs out quickraw.avs and quickraw-audio.avs
[22:55] <Mentar> 2) Ancient request, but still highly desired
[22:55] <Mentar> let yatta auto-import presets from a predefined .yap

Scan all plugins automatically in the selected dir instead of keeping a complicated list up to date?

[01:22] <Kovensky> Myrsloik: basically, resizable video window, with scrollbars to scroll the video
