[22:57] <Myrsloik> like adding them to all new projects?
[22:57] <Mentar> there are certain things I need to do all the time
[22:57] <Mentar> and adding Reblend as Custom list and importing the default presets are among the most annoying
[23:00] <Myrsloik> this requires the invention of a badly crafted system using weird delimiters and a hereto unknown file format...
[23:01] <Mentar> how about the ability to define a "default yap"
[23:01] <Mentar> and when ymc creates a new project, the settings from this default yap are loaded
[23:01] <Mentar> would that be possible?
[23:02] <Myrsloik> yes, I guess so
[23:02] <Myrsloik> what settings should it be possible to copy? custom lists? sections? presets?
[23:03] <Mentar> custom lists, presets, cropping/resizing defaults

[21:34] <Mentar> could you do this:
[21:34] <Mentar> When you change a match this way, could you shift the section boundary accordingly?
[21:34] <Mentar> as in, if you change a match to next frame, could you push the section boundary one to the next too?
[21:35] <Mentar> no wait it's the other way around
[21:35] <Mentar> if you change it to next frame, it needs to be moved -1
[21:36] <Mentar> or is my brain rotten
[21:36] <Mentar> wait
[21:36] <Mentar> I've drunken too much
[21:36] <Mentar> once I'm sober again, I'll write it down properly ^_^;
[21:37] <Mentar> currently, one effect is that if you use it, you sometimes have one frame "overlap", which makes the section boundary seem off by 1 frame

Add aegisub keyframe file import support, example in mirc dl dir

[01:06] <ViruX> since the topic was YATTA questions, i have two questions as well: what does the "Extend Distance to 5" hotkey do? Is there any hotkey to switch active custom list(like there is for current preset used on the section)?


[12:38] <TheFluff> Myrsloik: yatta "bug": save small avs doesn't apply the ymc cutter trimmings
[12:40] <TheFluff> quotation marks because I'm not sure if it's a bug or intended behavior

save "error log" to project and load on open

[00:21] <Mentar> did you already fix that the "select smalles vmetric at scenechanges" function has an uninitialized default?

[21:57] <Mentar> the YMC requests:
[21:57] <Mentar> please add an option which:
[21:58] <Mentar> 1) creates a copy of the .avs you use for analyzing - for a "cut quick-and-dirty raw with telecide and decimate"
[21:58] <Mentar> so that for a TLraw I don't need to wait for YMC to finish
[21:58] <Mentar> see what I mean?
[21:58] <Myrsloik> ok
[21:58] <Myrsloik> should be doable I guess
[21:59] <Mentar> 2) creates an audio.avs which takes the audio.aac file, extracts the displacement, and does a "Save Audio AVS"
[21:59] <Mentar> the dgindex output is normed, it should be easy to scan
[22:00] <Myrsloik> like with the audio file writer plugin or something?
[22:00] <Mentar> would that be okay? It would really help alot
[22:00] <Myrsloik> I guess
[22:00] <Myrsloik> so
[22:00] <Mentar> you know what "Save Audio AVS" does in Yatta - basically, the same thing
[22:00] <Myrsloik> now excuse me for I must work on my heart attack
[22:00] <Mentar> so that the quick-and-dirty TLraw can have audio too
