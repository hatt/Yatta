<Mentar> make a hotkey for this functionality:
<Mentar> "extend this preset backwards to its last instance"
<Mentar> example is simpler to explain:
<Mentar> you go through the sections sequentially
<Mentar> and apply "preset B" where A is default
<Mentar> then it would be nice if there were a key which checks "what's the preset of the current section" and then goes section-1, section-2, ...section-n
ccc ccccc cccc   ccc

skip import of default preset in new projects and importing from another project
auto extract audio offfset

Fix memory leak when closing ymc programmatically
fix edge case frame trim(0,0) kept when cutting
zoom out in ymc dialogs, general implementation?
cutter allows insertion of overlapping ranges?

[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:34] <Mentar> could you do this:
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:34] <Mentar> When you change a match this way, could you shift the section boundary accordingly?
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:34] <Mentar> as in, if you change a match to next frame, could you push the section boundary one to the next too?
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:35] <Mentar> no wait it's the other way around
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:35] <Mentar> if you change it to next frame, it needs to be moved -1
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:36] <Mentar> or is my brain rotten
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:36] <Mentar> wait
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:36] <Mentar> I've drunken too much
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:36] <Mentar> once I'm sober again, I'll write it down properly ^_^;
[20:08] <Myrsloik> [21:37] <Mentar> currently, one effect is that if you use it, you sometimes have one frame "overlap", which makes the section boundary seem off by 1 frame
[20:08] <Myrsloik> and you never sobered up
[20:09] <Mentar> hmmm
[20:11] <Mentar> I need to make a few more tests if what I think it does really does it
[20:11] <Mentar> maybe you can help me think
[20:11] <Mentar> if the "auto-boundary" function changes the match of a frame
[20:11] <Myrsloik> I don't know what to think
[20:11] <Mentar> okay, let me rephrase
[20:11] <Mentar> the auto-small-vthresh-at-boundary changes a match of a frame
[20:12] <Mentar> if it changes the match "backwards" (like, by changing to "p"), then make sure that the section ENDS on this frame
[20:13] <Mentar> if it changes the match "forwards", make sure that the new section BEGINS on this frame
[20:13] <Mentar> see what I mean?
[20:13] <Myrsloik> ok, so it's only when doing that kind of thing?
[20:13] <Mentar> right

save "error log" to project and load on open

[00:21] <Mentar> did you already fix that the "select smalles vmetric at scenechanges" function has an uninitialized default?

[22:52] <Mentar> 1) in ymc, could we have an option that when YMC starts working off a job with cutter and stuff, we get a copy of an .avs file for a quick workraw (and preferably also audio avs file)?
[22:52] <Mentar> this is the background
[22:53] <Mentar> I'd like to be able to encode a quick crapraw immediately, at the same time I do the ymc metrics collection
[22:53] <Mentar> so that the translator can start work immediately
[22:53] <Mentar> something like this should only be a variation of the .avs you need to create anyway
[22:53] <Mentar> right?
[22:54] <Mentar> so, optimal usage would be a "quickraw" entry like SCXvid and the likes, and it simply barfs out quickraw.avs and quickraw-audio.avs
